					Welcome! <br /> I'm a versatile creative professional with 7+ years of graphic design expertise. Recently, I've rekindled my love for web development, and I'm now proficient in crafting seamless websites that are both aesthetically stunning and functionally outstanding!

I find joy in bringing beautiful things to lifeâ€”sewing clothes and dolls, crafting Jesmonite objects, designing stationery, building event decor and leaving my mark through screen and block printing... There are no limits to what my hands can create!</p>
